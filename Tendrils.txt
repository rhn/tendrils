"Once again, if you haven't downloaded "Tendrils" yet, DO IT! And if you haven't downloaded lately, DO IT AGAIN! The latest update is up and it just gets better with each one.

As dumplechan 'splains it, "Tendrils" is an RPG Remix, sampling graphics, music, sounds, and yes, even dungeons, from other games that you've probably played at some point in your life. And of course, it has a unique combat system, aka "rhythmic combat", for fans of music-based games such as "Dance Dance Revolution" or "Parappa the Rapper". " - schwa

"For example, I have no qualms getting a few perfects and then unloading 3 or 4 Chocobos in a row during each battle to get the AAA rating (exp x 5!).  I admit, it is cheesy, but very, very fun." - Frank chang

"...I'm going to mope at home while playing Tendrils 'til my
fingers bleed.  BLEED, I tell you!" -- B.Chas Parisher

"Awesome game dude!! I just played tendrils last night until 2:00 am last 
night; I may need a twelve step program. It's progressing well, I see." - Mike Hall

"P.S. I'll be waiting for the next installment of tendrils . . . I need a 
bard!! Dude, you totally rock! Tendrils is definitely one of the most 
playable games I've seen in along time. DDRPG is a cool concept!" - Mike Hall

"And great job on Tendrils! I haven't had much time lately to play much of anything, but your work on this is really impressive." - Matthew Reinhold

"...The rythmic thing for defense and attacking? Genius. Amazing..." - Matthew Reinhold

"I'm envious.  Really cool, and no serious bugs so far!" - Eric Boesch

"Ahhh, you bastard, you mirrored the second level at that "warp and
weft" spot, didn't you?  No wonder i was getting lost!@#$@!$" - rone

"I LOVE IT!!!  I think it is sooooooo groovy.  I can't say how excited I am
to see it in action.  Very, very, very groovy." - Sean Curtis

"SWT is damned for half of eternity for getting me one step closer to playing 'Dance Dance Revolution'". - rone

21 Feb 22:17 - (Friend) Solwyn: 'To be honest, it's seemed fairly easy so far, although I hadn't had it on manic until recently (as I hadn't realized I could change it whenever I like [whoops])'
21 Feb 22:18 - (Friend) Solwyn: 'However.. I like it. I really like it.'

Broken arrows after a summon :(
Shield image back
* "1 hit" : do lightgrey, then white
* Turn is not frozen by a summon; the turn never happens!!





- Ranking B SFX
- More music for blocks/blinken/pegs
*- "Moves:" updates right away when blinkenlights is solved
- Better instructions on key config screen (plug in before starting tendrils, etc)
? Psyco.full() produces a crash
? We rely upon the fact that SDL gives a broken song position (time since start, disregarding pauses)

*) If you press esc during a song and then continue, and the song ends, it doesn't start from the beginning, but at the place where you pressed esc. I'm not entirely sure if this always happens, but I've seen it happening a few times so it might be worth checking. 
I can confirm the inventory bug. For me it happened on level 4 after coming out of the inn where I changed my party setup once and recruited a ninja, who was left at the inn.

*Place the three puzzle boxes.

(a) Labels on the "special items" menu would sometimes be painted black on black. I'd see all three of my items once, and the next time I'd see one of them, and the time after that I'd see none of them. I could click on the label but I couldn't see it. 

"Dumapic" claims to list north first and east second. Surely that's the problem -- just exchange the words "north" and "east", and the problem is fixed. 

Also, another minor one -- I was on level 3 and chose a New game, and I ended up starting out on level 3. (Mysteriously, I then chose New game a second time and ended up on level 1 as expected, I think.)
