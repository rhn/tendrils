Tendrils: The all-singing, all-dancing, role-playing game remix!

ABOUT THE GAME:
Tendrils is an RPG where combat uses a rhythm game (like Dance Dance Revolution, or Parappa the Rapper).  Your
party's success depends on their stats, but also on accurate arrow-stomping.  Characters explore a large grid-
based maze, solve puzzles, discover power-ups (like powerful items, new spells for their wizards), and eventually
fight Mother Brain, the evillest and toughest of the enemies.  Most of the music, art, and sound effects come
from classic video games.
