FirstGreet|A group of heroes, brave and bold\n
Has come to see the land of cold.\n
I strike a tone on the Gong of Greeting\n
To herald this momentous meeting.\n\n
My name is Syntessa.  I am a bard, a skald, a spinner of tales, a listener to the Music of the World.~
Hello, Syntessa.|Main
~
SecondGreet|Salutations, brave explorers\n
Take refuge here from dungeon's horrors\n
Sheathe your blades, and dry your shoes\n
And tell me your exciting news!~
Hello again, Syntessa.|Main
~
Main|So, what would you like to hear about?~
What is this place?|ThisLevel
Do you have any bard advice?|BardTips
Can you help us?|NextLevel|NotLearnedBardTech
We must leave now.|Bye
~
ThisLevel|This is a realm of endless snow,\n
Where unforgiving ice winds blow.\n
Mazes and monsters everywhere,\n
But you can get through if you dare.
~
Must you speak in rhyme?|Rhyme
We had other questions.|Main
~
Rhyme|Rhyme is important.  Magic flows from a bard's enchanted instruments, but the rhythm and
sound of a bard's song are what control the magic, and turn it to its proper purpose.~
We had other questions.|Main
We must leave now.|Bye
~
Bye|Farewell!  I hope someday to sing of your great success.~
Goodbye. [Done]|None

BardTips|The most important thing for bards is to work on their Charisma (CHA).  Charisma helps them
control the music of battle, and helps recover magic points for the spellcasters.  But having lots of
Strength and Dexterity is useful, too.~
We had other questions.|Main
We must leave now.|Bye
~
NextLevel|I cannot come with you on your quest.  But I can tell you this: There is a <CN:BRIGHTBLUE>wall of ice</C>
along the way which only a bard could hope to break.~
Then, can you teach us to break it?|||TeachBreak
Use a bard?  Pah!  We'll just hit it harder!|NoBard
~
NoBard|Never underestimate the powers of a bard.  Especially if your name rhymes with something unpleasant.~
We had other questions.|Main
Hmph.  We're leaving now.|Bye
~
TeachBreakNo|I'm afraid none of you have quite the artistic temperment needed for this task.  Bring me a bard,
and then I'll have something to work with.~
Where can we find a bard?|FindBard
Very well - we'll be back.|Bye
~
FindBard|Wherever there is good food, fine wine, and a crowd of people, you can find bards.  Go to an <CN:GREEN>inn</C>
and you should be able to <CN:GREEN>recruit</C> a bard without much trouble.~
We had other questions.|Main
We must leave now.|Bye
~
TeachBreakYes|Very well.  Watch closely, as good technique is essential.  I take this violin, carved under
moonlight by elven craftsemn.  I hold it like so, and take this bow woven from spider's silk.~
Go on.|TeachBreakYes15
~
TeachBreakYes15|I place my fingers firmly, but gracefully, and prepare myself mentally and spiritually...~
And then?|TeachBreakYes2|||LearnBardTech
~
TeachBreakYes2|...and thus, I play the song of opening!  This song can break the <CN:BRIGHTBLUE>ice wall</C>
and allow you to pass.~
Thank you, Syntessa!|Taught
Aiiiie!  So...awful!|Awful
~
Taught|Don't mention it.  I wish you the best of luck in your quest.~
We had other questions.|Main
We must leave now.|Bye
~
Awful|Philistines!  Clearly, you don't appreciate the true <CN:RED>greatness</C> of my art!  Well, laugh if
you like, but future generations will remember my dramatic innovations in barding.
My "Sonata for Orc and Goomba" will live on, long after my passing!~
Whoa, sorry!  Didn't mean to be so critical.|Main
Seriously.  Your sonic torture made my ears want to vomit.|NoBard
