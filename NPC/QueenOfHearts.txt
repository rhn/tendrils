JoinNow|Hello again, Blezmoticians!  That was quite an impressive game.  I watched it from the royal box, and
I was rooting for you all along!  And so, as I promised, so I shall deliver: The Army of Hearts is ready to
follow you into battle against the Goblins.~
Splendid!|Main
Wonderful!  And now, we must go. [Done]|None

FirstGreet|Greetings and salutations, new subjects!  I am the Queen of Hearts.  I rule over the Eastern Kingdom,
full of love.~
Hello, your majesty.|Main

SecondGreet|Ah, here you are back again!  Strange, isn't it, that no matter how fast one runs, one always ends
up in the same place, doesn't one?  You are always welcome here.~
Thank you, your majesty.|Main

again.  I really must ask the Royal Plaquesmith about putting up a plaque in your honor.~

Help|Well, I'm not sure I could muster the troops at the moment.  You see, the Blezmon tournament sometimes takes
rather a long time.  This year, there have been several ties.  We usually play the best two out of four games, you
see.  This year we tried the best three out of six, but that didn't seem to fix things.  Maybe next year we'll
try the best four out of eight...~
What if we defeat your Blezmon champion?|BlezQuest
~
BlezQuest|Well, if you can defeat the champion, that would wrap up the tourney quite nicely.  Otherwise, the whole
thing might spill over into yet another month.  The Blezmon Statium is off to the south; watch out for wandering
monsters along the way.~
So, what is Blezmon, anyway?|Blezmon
We had some other questions.|Main
~
News|Haven't you heard?  There's a <CN:ORANGE>Shivan Dragon</C> on this level!  And what's worse, he's in
command of a veritable army of goblins.  And this couldn't have happened at a worse time; the <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>Blezmon</C>
tournament is in full swing.~

King1|Normally, His Majesty would be right here by my side.  Unfortunately, he had a bit of an accident.  It was
the Knave's fault, really.  You see, I had just finished baking some strawberry tarts, and set them out to cool.
The Knave stole them, and went running off.~
And what happened then?|King2
~
King2|Well, the King went chasing after the Knave.  Suddenly, he slipped on his royal robe, and as he fell...well, 
he stabbed himself.  In the head.  With his sword.~
Oh, I'm sorry.|King3
~
King3|It was quite a tragedy.  But we have managed to carry on.  Love conquers all, as we like to say!
~
How brave of you.|Main
~
Kingdoms|Well, there's the Kingdom of Clubs in the South.  There's also the Kingdom of Diamonds, far to the West.
And the Kingdom of Spades is to the North.  Their army is the strongest.  Still, I think you would probably need
to <CN:BRIGHTBLUE>gather all four armies</c> in order to defeat the goblins.~
Interesting.|Main

BlezmonAlreadyDone|Ah, Blezmon!  A wonderful game.  You did quite a fine job in the tourney, by the way.  I hope
you can stop by next year, if the forces of evil haven't destroyed all that's good and wholesome by then.~
We'll try.|Main
~
Blezmon1|Blezmon?  Oh, it's a fine game.  The rattle of the dice, the roar of the crowd...  You see, the two players take
turns rolling five dice, trying to get the highest score.  You can get <CN:RED>groups of numbers</C>, or
<CN:RED>combinations</C>, or even a <CN:BRIGHTRED>Blezmon</C>.~

What are combinations?|Blezmon4
What is a "Blezmon"?|Blezmon5
Ok, that's enough about Blezmon for now.|Main
~
Blezmon2|Well, you roll the five dice.  You can choose to re-roll some or all of them, and then you can choose
to re-roll some a second time.  Then, you take the points in a row on your scorecard.  You can fill the rows in
any order, that's most of the strategy.  And once your scorecard is full, you're done, and if you scored the
most points, you win.~

Ok, that's enough about Blezmon for now.|Main
~
Blezmon3|The scorecard has <CN:GREEN>number rows</C> for ones, twos, and so on up to sixes.  For those rows, you
try to roll as many of that number as you can.  For instance, four sixes let you score a total of 24 on
the "sixes" row.  The number rows aren't worth as much as <CN:GREEN>combinations</c>, but there's a
<CN:GREEN>bonus</c> for scoring a high total on the number rows.~

Blezmon4|There are several combinations.  For instance, a <CN:GREEN>4-of-a-kind</C> can be filled by any four
numbers - four sixes is worth the most, but even four ones works.  The <CN:GREEN>straight</C> is filled by a run
of numbers - one through five, or two through six.  I've heard that beginners can <CN:GREEN>right-click</c> their
scorecard to get an explanation of how to fill each row, that probably helps them learn the game.~

Blezmon5|The "Blezmon" is where you roll 5 of the same number.  It's worth a bonus 50 points, and the crowd
loves it!~
