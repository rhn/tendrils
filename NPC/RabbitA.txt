Bye|Thanks for stopping by, dearies!~
Bye, Kuni [Done]|None

FirstGreet|Oh, goodness gracious me!  Some adventurers, I do declare!  Sakes alive!
~
Hello, Ms. Rabbit.  We come in peace.|FirstGreet2
~
GetArmy|Hello there!  Klo and I have a nice surprise for you: An army!  
\n\n<CN:ORANGE>[ Kuni gestures at a batallion of 832,040 rabbits in infantry gear. ]</c>
\n\nIf you'd waited a bit longer, we could have had an army of 1,346,269.  But
this should be plenty.  Say hello to the nice adventurers, kids!
\n\n<CN:ORANGE>[ The army of rabbits salute, then fall into formation behind you ]</c>
~
Where did all these rabbits come from?|Army2
You and Klo have been...busy.|Army2
~
Army2|Well, when two rabbits love each other very much...it doesn't take long before
there are plenty <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>more</C> rabbits.  Now storming that castle should
be no problem at all!~
Onward to glory.|Main
Lagomorph power!|Main
~
FirstGreet2|Oh, no need to be formal.  You may call me Kuni, because that is
my name.  And now, please sit down and have some tea.  I do wish I
could offer you some crumpets, but they are rather hard to find these
days.  This neighborhood has really become frightfully uncivilized
since Mother Brain's legions of death invaded.  Legions of death will
do that, you know.
~
So, what's new?|Main
Sorry, just popping in.  Bye! [Done]|Bye
~
Greet|Oh, my stars and garters!  The human adventurers have come
calling again.  And here I am, with no crumpets to offer them.  I do
hope you'll find it in your hearts to forgive me.~
Um...sure.|Main
Oh, don't give it another thought.|Main
Actually, we've brought some crumpets.  Here.|GiveCrumpets|HaveCrumpet||CrumpTrigger
No crumpets?  We're out of here. [Done]|Bye
~
GiveCrumpets|Oh, goodness me!  These look just scrumptious!  How very wonderful of you to bring them by.  Thank
you ever so much.~
Glad you like them.|Main
So, can you do something for us in return?|||HelpUsPost
~
GreetCrumpet|Hello, dearies!  I hope things are going well for you.  I'm so glad you could pop in for
a visit.~
Hello again, Kuni.|Main
~
Main|Well now, what would you like to chat about?~
Who's that other rabbit?||MetOtherRabbit|OtherRabbitPost
How do we get off this level?|||OffLevelPost
So, what's going on around here?|GoingOn
Thanks for the tea, Kuni.  We should be going now.|Bye
~
GoodLuck|Hello, adventurers.  Ah, I see you have the whole Rabbit Army with you.  Getting ready to assault the
castle, are we?  Come in, bunnies, and have a chat with your Auntie Kuni!~
Hello again.|Main
~
Congrats|Hello, dearies!  I'm so pleased that the attack on the castle went well.  I set up a lawn chair on the roof
so I could watch the whole thing.  It was quite splendid.~
It was amazing.  You should have been there.|HandleLabor
Hello again.|Main
~
HandleLabor|I would have come, but I'm not really the fighting sort.  But don't worry, I was cheering
for you the whole time! It all looks ever so exciting.  But I suppose
someone had to stay home and look after the house.
~
Yeah, I guess.|Main
Don't feel bad, we couldn't have done it without the rabbit army.  We did the work, but you did the labor.|Main
~
OffLevelBefore|The stairway up is just outside the house.  You could get back up that way, and I can't say I'd
blame you, what with all the monsters about.~
Yes, but what about the stairs down?|StairsDownBefore
So, what's going on around here?|GoingOn
Who's that other rabbit?||MetOtherRabbit|OtherRabbitPost
Thanks for the tea, Kuni.  We should be going now.|Bye
~
StairsDownBefore|Oh, the stairs <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>down</C>?  That's another story.  They're at the center of the
Castle of Fear, guarded by demonic hordes and undead scourges and that sort of thing, don't you know.  It would
take an <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>army</c> to break through.~
So, what's going on around here?|GoingOn
Who's that other rabbit?||MetOtherRabbit|OtherRabbitPost
Any chance you could help us?|||HelpUsPost
Thanks for the tea, Kuni.  We should be going now.|Bye
~
OffLevelAfter|The stairway up is just outside the house.  And the stairway down is inside the Castle of Fear.  Now
that the castle is taken, you can go onward any time - but do be careful!~
So, what's going on around here?|GoingOn
Who's that other rabbit?||MetOtherRabbit|OtherRabbitPost
Thanks for the tea, Kuni.  We should be going now.|Bye
~
HelpUsA|Help you?  Well, I don't know about that.  I'm still a little upset over my crumpet crisis.
And I don't think I'd be much good against a demnic horde.  I'm not
even sure what a demonic horde looks like.  Is it like a horse?~
No, a whole HORDE of demons.  You know, "horde" as in "army".|OoGhastly
Yes, a little bit like a horse.  A horse...OF THE DAMNED!|OoGhastly
~
OoGhastly|Oooo, how ghastly!  You'll give me nightmares, talking like that.  Let's talk about something else.~
Who's that other rabbit?||MetOtherRabbit|OtherRabbitPost
How do we get off this level?|||OffLevelPost
So, what's going on around here?|GoingOn
Thanks for the tea, Kuni.  We should be going now.|Bye
~
HelpUsB|Well, you did bring me those crumpets, so I really feel like I ought to help you out.  Maybe if you could
talk that stubborn bunny Klo into apologizing to me, the two of us could be of use to you.~
We'll try.|Main
We'll go give it a try right now.|Bye
~
HelpUsC|First you find crumpets, and then you talk Klo into saying something nice.  You <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>are</c>
a bunch of miracle workers, aren't you?  Well now, Klo and I should be able to help you out.  It won't take
long.  Come back in...mmm...one day, all right?  Now run along, dearies!~
Bye now. [Done]|None
~
HelpUsD|Oh, I think you are quite ready to attack the castle already!  Don't underestimate <CN:red>the wrath of
the rabbit army</c>.~
Ok.|Main
~
GoingOn|It's been an eventful month.  Let's see...there was a spaceship crash a week ago.  And the other day, I saw
a horrible snake.  Ooh, and yesterday, I tripped and broke one of my china teacups!
~
A spaceship crash?|Spaceship
A horrible snake?|Snake
Sounds like quite a month.|Main
Thanks for the tea, Kuni.  We should be going now.|Bye
~
Spaceship|Yes, it made a tremendous crashing sound.  I think I saw the pilot hop out at the last minute, and hide out
to the northeast.  I do hope he's all right, the poor dear.  It must have been quite upsetting.~
What else has been happening?|GoingOn
~
Snake|Ooo, it was horrible!  I saw its forky tongue, and everything.  It was a huge thing, all slithery and slimy!
~
What else has been happening?|GoingOn
Actually, snake scales are quite dry.|Snake2
~
Snake2|Well, that may be so.  But you wouldn't see me getting close enough to find out what its scales are
like, thank you very much!~
What else has been happening?|GoingOn
~
OtherRabbitJerk|Oh, Klo is such a <CN:BRIGHTRED>beast</C>!  He said the most frightful thing to me the other day.
I haven't spoken to him since.  I wouldn't pay any attention to him if I were you, because he's nothing but
a mean, rude...  Hmph!~
I see.|Main
What did he say to you?|WhatSay
~
WhatSay|Well, it was a remark in such poor taste that I will not deign to repeat it.~
I see.|Main
Oh, go on.|WhatSay2
~
WhatSay2|Oh, you do pry, don't you?  Well, I'm sorry, but my civil and ladylike nature will simply not permit me
to repeat such a horrid utterance, and that is that.~
Oh well.|Main
~
OtherRabbitNice|Klo can say the most awful things, sometimes.  But just recently he apologized
for something he said, and he did it quite nicely too, so I forgave him.
It's hard to stay mad at Klo.  He's just so dreamy.~
What a guy.|Main
Does that mean you LIKE him?|IHeartKlo
~
IHeartKlo|Oh, you silly, how could I <CN:BRIGHTRED>not</C> like him?  Just look at those ears.
~
Um...yes, I see what you mean.|Main
~
