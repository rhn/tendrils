JoinNow|Oh, thank you for freeing the High Priestess!  Now the danger to the kingdom is over, at least
for now.  And so, as I promised, so I shall deliver: The Army of Clubs is ready to follow you into battle
against the Goblins.~
Superb!|Main
Excellent!  And now, we must go. [Done]|None

FirstGreet|Ah, hello, scary new people.  You must be adventurers, because you haven't tried to stab me yet.  I
am the King of Clubs, ruler of the Kingdom of Hope.~
Hello, your majesty.|Main

MainDone|Now that you defeated the Shivan Dragon and his army of goblins, the Four Kingdoms are at peace
again.  We are busy rebuilding at this point, but we hope you'll come back and visit when things are
back to normal.~
We'll do that. [Done]|None

WhySword|Hmm...I suppose it does break the theme a bit.  There <CN:PURPLE>IS</C> a King of Swords, but he lives far away, close to
the King of Pentacles and the King of Cups.  Anyway, you're one to talk.  You guys still look the same no matter what
you're wielding or wearing.~
You've got a point there.|Main
~
Help|I'm afraid we're already in some bad trouble.  We're the weakest of the four kingdoms, I'll 
admit.  The west edge of our lands was overrun by mad beasts, and they have built a strange black tower
there.  It's a twisted, black thing, of impossible angles, and makes your head hurt just to look at it.
Our High Priestess has become lost in the tower, and without her guidance, the army cannot act.~
What if we bring back the priestess?|TowerQuestHaveTwine|HaveTwine

TowerQuestHaveTwine|Well, if you could bring the High Priestess back, we would surely join you.  Be careful, though: In
the tower, you can go north, south, east, west, up and down, and...<CN:PURPLE>this-a-way</c> and <CN:PURPLE>that-a-way</c>.  It's a
confusing place.  Use <CN:GREEN>Ariadne's Thread</c> to escape if you get lost.~
We had some other questions.|Main
Don't worry, we'll bring her back. [Done]|None

And some peasants claimed that a <CN:BRIGHTRED>Shivan dragon</C> swooped down and ate some of their sheep yesterday.
Oh, the weight of leadership weighs heavy on my head...~

Just go down the hall, take the door on the left, you can't miss it.  And I hear there's 
a <CN:YELLOW>save shrine</C> on the level, but I'm not sure quite where.~
