GreetingNewbie|Well, what have we here?  It looks like a party of new adventurers.  You've come
to the right place if you want a little training.  I can give you some handy tips to get started,
and my rates are <CN:RED>very</C> reasonable.~
What can you tell us about?|Main
No thanks.|Bye
~
Greeting|Well, hello there!  You look like an experienced bunch.  Still, it never hurts to review
the basics.  Would you be interested in learning something?~
Sure.|Main
No thanks.|Bye
~
GreetingDead|Oh dear!  It looks like your friend there is feeling a little bit dead.  You should
head straight over to the Inn and get patched up!  The Inn is at the southwest end of town.~
Okay.|Bye
~
GreetingLate|Well, you folks are <CN:YELLOW>*yawn*</C> certainly up late.  Still, I guess when you're
saving the world you don't always <CN:YELLOW>*yawn*</C> get to keep regular hours.  Anyway, are
you here for some training?~
Sure.|Main
No thanks.|Bye
~
GreetingNewYears|Happy New Year!  Time to party down, because if the monster raids keep coming, 
we may not make it through another year!  Eat, drink, and be merry, and so forth!  Ah, but if
you like, I can give you some training.~
Sure.|Main
No thanks.|Bye

GreetingChristmasPresent|Merry Christmas!  Ah, I'm drunk on yuletide cheer.  And on egg nog.  Since
I heard you people were heading off on such a hazardous journey, I thought I would give you this.
Go ahead, unwrap it.\n\n<CENTER><CN:YELLOW>You received: Red Ryder BB-Gun</C>~
Wow, thanks!|Main|||PresentTrigger

GreetingChristmasNoPresent|Merry Christmas!  Ah, I'm drunk on yuletide cheer.  And on egg nog.~
Merry Christmas to you, too.|Main
Bah, humbug!|Main

GreetingAprilFools|Ah!  Thank goodness you've come!  A giant werewolf is attacking the villagers
and devouring their shoes!  It can shoot fire out of its mouth, and its only weakness is cheese, 
and...<CN:BRIGHTRED>OH NO!  There is is...BEHIND YOU!</C>
\n\n
Just kidding.  April Fools!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!~
Ha, good one.|Main
You're funny.  Reeeeeal funny.  That's why I'll kill you last.|Main

Farewell1|What?  Leaving so soon?  But the fun's just getting started!  Come on lad, let's set our
hair on fire!~
We really should be going. [Done]|
~
Farewell2|Goodbye, and good luck.  Oh!  I just remembered...  Some mages cast a big Detect Magic
spell the other day, and they said there are three spells hidden on the second level.  Or was it
four?  No, definitely four - a Cleric, a Mage, and a Summoner spell.  I don't 
know whether that tidbit of information will come in handy or not, but there you are.~
Bye now. [Done]|
~
Farewell3|Farewell.  And remember: The character in the front takes the most damage from 
monsters.  Characters on the flank take 1/4 less damage, and the character
in back takes 1/2 as much.~
Bye now. [Done]|
~
Main|I can teach you some things about <CN:GREEN>Attributes</C>, about <CN:GREEN>perks</C>, or about
<CN:GREEN>status ailments</C>.  It costs 100 zenny for each lesson - and believe me, it's worth it.
What'll it be?~
Tell us about attributes.|||AttributePost
Tell us about perks.|||PerksPost
Tell us about status ailments.|||StatusPost
We'll be going now.|Bye
~
NotEnoughMoney|What?  You don't have 100 zenny?  No money, no lesson.  Go kill yourselves some
monsters, get some funds.~
Ok.  [Done]|

Status|<CN:YELLOW>[You have paid 100 zenny]</C>\n\n
Well, in addition to doing damage, monsters can do some other nasty things.  They can poison you,
which makes you take damage every so often.  They can put you to sleep, which means you can't
attack until something hits you to wake you up.  They can silence you, which prevents you from
casting spells.  And they can paralyze you, or turn you to stone,
and that means you can't do anything until you recover.\n\n
There are items to fix all these problems.  <CN:YELLOW>Antidotes</c> cure poison, 
<CN:YELLOW>Black Coffee</C> cures sleep and
paralysis, <CN:YELLOW>Medusa Scales</C> cure stoning, and <CN:YELLOW>Flutes</C> cure silence.  A <CN:YELLOW>Remedy</C> will fix all status
problems, and so will the Cleric spell <CN:YELLOW>Esuna</C>, once you find it.  Staying at the inn fixes 
everything, too, so if you get poisoned and run out of antidotes, make a beeline for the
nearest inn!  You also recover from these things over time - 
the higher your CON, the faster you get better.\n\n
The good news is: Some equipment makes you immune to status ailments.  And it's possible for 
you to dish out status ailments to the monsters, if you have the right sort of weapons and 
armor.  Also, watch for the perk "Recovery" - that makes you recover from status problems
three times as fast.~
Interesting.|Main
~
Perks|<CN:YELLOW>[You have paid 100 zenny]</C>\n\n
Some items have special powers, called <CN:brightblue>perks</c>, which you can use by equipping
them.  For instance, the <CN:green>Regen</c> perk restores hit points automatically over
time.  The <CN:green>Haste</c> perk makes you faster at casting spells, using items - even
fleeing from combat.  There are perks like <CN:green>Poison Immune</c> which prevent status
problems, and perks like <CN:green>Sleep Strike</c> which let you cause status problems to
the monsters.  I've even heard of items that provide <CN:green>X-ray Vision</c>, which 
reveals all the secret doors in the dungeon...\n\n
Now, you can only
get each perk once - so if you put two <CN:green>Resist Fire</c> items on the same character, their
fire resistance doesn't get any better than if they had just one. \n\n
You can check your perks from the equipment screen.  Sometimes 
it's worth passing up an item with better stats to get the perks it gives.~
Interesting.|Main
~
Attributes|<CN:YELLOW>[You have paid 100 zenny]</C>\n\n
Attributes determine how good your character is at doing things - the higher they are, the better.
You can increase attributes when you gain a level, and there is equipment out there that affects
them.
Monsters have the same stats that you do, so you'll meet some monsters that are smarter or stronger
than others. 
\n
<CN:RED>Strength</C> (<CN:BRIGHTRED>STR</C>) affects how much damage you do with your attacks.\n
<CN:RED>Dexterity</C> (<CN:BRIGHTRED>DEX</C>) measures how good you are at hitting and dodging.  If
your DEX is higher than a monster's, your attacks will connect more often, and you'll dodge more of
its blows.\n
<CN:RED>Constitution</C> (<CN:BRIGHTRED>CON</C>) affects your maximum HP.  It also helps you
recover faster from things like poison and paralysis.\n
<CN:RED>Intelligence</C> (<CN:BRIGHTRED>INT</C>) controls Mage and Summoner spell power and 
maximum MP.  It also helps all characters take less damage from magic.\n
<CN:RED>Wisdom</C> (<CN:BRIGHTRED>WIS</C>) controls Cleric spell power and 
maximum MP.  It also controls your chance to dodge magic.\n
<CN:RED>Charisma</C> (<CN:BRIGHTRED>CHA</C>) controls Bard powers.  Also, a party with good
charisma gets better prices from shopkeepers.\n\n
All attributes are useful, but focus on raising the key attributes for your character's class first.~
