...|FirstNoSpeaky
I'm sorry, I don't understand.|FirstNoSpeaky
Uh... buzz buzz, buzz?|FirstNoSpeaky
~
FirstNoSpeaky|Ah, I see, you don't speak Bee.  Sorry about that.  Don't worry, we can speak 
your language.  BOW TO THE SWARM!  Er, I mean to say, nice to meet you.~
Wait, bees can't talk!|CanTalk
What's with this "BOW TO THE SWARM" talk?|SomewhatEvil
What are you doing here in this dungeon?|SmartBees
Say, could we have some honey?|WantHoney|HoneyPre
~
Greetings|Hello again, humans!  I hope your quest is going well.\n\n
Things have been quiet around here lately, nothing interesting in the recon reports.  We've sent
out lots of scouts lately to find more flowers so we can make more honey AND CRUSH ALL OPPOSITION!~
What do you mean, "CRUSH"?|SomewhatEvil
How is it that you guys can talk?|CanTalk
How come you bees are so intelligent?|SmartBees
Say, could we have some honey?|WantHoney|HoneyPre
Interesting.  Well, we need to continue our quest.|Bye
~
CanTalk|Of course bees can talk!  Normally, we communicate by dancing, of course.  But most PUNY HU-MANS
don't understand, and anyway, they don't have enough legs to dance properly.  So, we learned
human language.~
Yes, but how are you so intelligent?|SmartBees
Say, could we have some honey?|WantHoney|HoneyPre
Interesting.  Well, we need to continue our quest.|Bye
~
SmartBees|Well, we were once ordinary, thimble-sized bees, peacefully gathering pollen.  Then one day, 
our Queen was captured by Mother Brain.  She tried to turn us into a swarm of killing machines,
HARVESTING HONEY FROM THE VERY SOULS OF OUR FALLEN ENEMIES!  So the Queen was turned into a super-Queen, 
producing a swarm of super-intelligent bees.  Later, the Queen escaped, so we were free to build our hive
here.  And the "evil killing machine" training wore off.  Mostly.~
What do you mean, "mostly"?|SomewhatEvil
Do you know anything else about Mother Brain?|MotherBrain
Say, could we have some honey?|WantHoney|HoneyPre
Interesting.  Well, we need to continue our quest.|Bye
~
SomewhatEvil|Sometimes the evil training we received from Mother Brain breaks through a little bit.  
We wake up in the middle of the night, thinking "MUST...STING...HUMANS!"  It's pretty much under control,
though.  We never wanted to be Mother Brain's elite death squad; we just want a quiet life, harvesting 
pollen and making honey.~
Do you know anything else about Mother Brain?|MotherBrain
Say, could we have some honey?|WantHoney|HoneyPre
Interesting.  Well, we need to continue our quest.|Bye

MotherBrain|Mother Brain was some sort of planetary control device, in charge of all the major systems 
on some other world.  She - or it - went haywire.  Instead of just directing traffic and operating the
sprinkler systems like she was supposed to, she started ordering people around, and sending squads of 
monsters out to conquer nearby planets.  If she can take over Nexus, she'll be able to attack wherever
she pleases, and at that point there'd be no stoppnig her.  It's a bad situation, really.  Someone should 
probably do something about it.~
Say, could we have some honey?|WantHoney|HoneyPre
Interesting.  Well, we need to continue our quest.|Bye
~
WantHoney|Honey?\n\nOur precious, <CN:YELLOW>precious</C> HONEY!?\n\nWell, maybe.  But only if you do us an extra special
favor.~
What do you need?|WantHoney2
~
WantHoney2|Well, one of Mother Brain's underlings has set up a base on this level.  We're worried that 
he'll try to capture us, and take us back to Mother Brain's big army o' doom.  He's a strange sort of twisty iron
creature, and our poison sting is useless against him.\n\nIf you kill him for us, we will give you a bucket
of our finest honey.~
Sounds dangerous.  We'll do it.|HoneyQuestYes|ClippyNotDead
On second thought, maybe not.|HoneyQuestNo|ClippyNotDead
We have vanquished this foe.|HoneyQuestDone|ClippyDead||ClippyDeadTrigger
~
HoneyQuestYes|Bzzzzz!  You are brave, puny hu-mans.  Let me explain where he is.\n\n[ A bee dance is performed,
indicating that the minion is located due north of the beehive ]
~
We'll return when he is dead.|Bye
~
Bye|Farewell...and keep an eye out for flowers!~
Bye. [Done]|None
~
HoneyQuestNo|This izzzz disappointing.  But, I can't blame you PITIFUL MAMMALS for chickening out.
\n\nI hope you will come back and visit us later, if you change your mind.~
Bye. [Done]|None
~
HoneyQuestDone|Is this true?  Can this be?\n\n[ You present <CN:BRIGHTBLUE>The Head of Clippy</C> to the bees ]
\n\nWonderful!  We will be much safer now that that...thing...is dead.  Here, please take this <CN:YELLOW>honey</C>. ~
Thanks, giant bees!|Bye
