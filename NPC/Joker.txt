FirstGreet|O ho ho!  Come to set free the King of Spades?  Well, forget about it.  He was a fool, and 
turning him into a duck was unspeakably hilarious.  I could turn him into a kumquat, I suppose, or into 
a cow with smaller cows for feet.  But I couldn't turn him back now.  \n\nUnless...

I'll turn him back again.~
