JoinNow|I see that you have assembled an impressive force.  And so, I will ante up and cast my lot in with yours.
The Army of Diamonds will join you against the goblin force.~
Fabulous!|Main
Nifty!  And now, we must go. [Done]|None
~
FirstGreet|Greetings and salutations!  It is with inestimable pleasure that I extend my hospitality to the 
intrepid foursome who are contending with the eldritch forces of darkess.  I am the Queen of Diamonds, ruler
of the Kingdom of Knowledge.~
Thanks...I think.|Main
~
SecondGreet|Affability and delectation!  The plucky swashbucklers have suspended their exploits long enough 
to sojourn in my demesne.~
Greetings, your majesty.|Main
I'll be back when I figure out what that meant. [Done]|None

MainDone|Triumph and jubilation!  The wily wyrm has fallen before your terpsichordean prowess.  Now we can
get back to life as usual. ~
Thanks for your help.[Done]|None

JoinedMain|Panoply and readiness!  Our forces are prepared to fight.  Now, what plans shall we discuss?~
What news do you have?|News
Can you give us any advice?|Advice
Farewell, your Majesty. [Done]|None

UnjoinedMain|Upon which topic shall we dissertate?~
What news do you have?|News
Can you give us any advice?|Advice
Can you help us?|Help
Farewell, your Majesty. [Done]|None

Help|Help?  Against the goblin armies?  We salute and countenance your efforts, of course.  But our strategists 
estimate the odds of a successful attack on the goblins at what they called "miniscule at best".  Now, if the <CN:GREEN>other
three kingdoms</C> were to join you first, then it might well become judicious for us to muster our forces.
~
We will see what we can do.|Main
What are you, afraid to fight?|Afraid
~
Afraid|Prudent, yes.  Forethoughtful, certainly.  But once the four kingdoms are assembled, we will make manifest the valor 
and sinew of our nation, and you will know that we are no mere recreants.~
We'll be just fine, if you can fight as well as you talk.|Main
Very well then, we'll return when we've recruited the other kingdoms. Done]|None
~
News|The tidings are grim.  The goblins, unholy demihumans that they are, control the northeast fortress.  With them is a
truly bestial creature: a <CN:BRIGHTRED>Shivan dragon</C>.  Its very breath is a conflagration, and its 
hide a scaly wall.  To oppugn such a lusus naturae, you would do well to employ some sort of thaumaturgical gelidity.~
Thauma-whatsical who?|Gelidity
We had some other questions.|Main
Listening to you hurts my brain.  I'm leaving. [Done]|None
~
Gelidity|Some form of <CN:BRIGHTBLUE>cold magic</C>, you lumpenproletariat.  Honestly, sometimes I wonder why I bother.
~
We had some other questions.|Main

Advice|I have only this counsel: Hidden on this level is a druidic sanctorum.  The ecclesiastics there may be able to teach
you any hallowed incantations that have been overlooked in your questings hitherto.~
We had some other questions.|Main
Farewell, your Majesty. [Done]|None
