SecondGreet|Hello again!  Have you seen any sign of my spaceship parts?~
Yes, we've got them here.|GotParts|HaveParts
Not yet.  Any idea where they are?|PleaseFindParts|NotHaveParts
~
RewardForFix|The starship?  It's fixed?  Hooray!  Now I can get off this frogforsaken planet and head 
back home.  And here, take these - they're a couple of items I found during the survey.~
Why, thanks!|Farewell|||RewardTrig
~
Farewell|I know it's not much, but it's the least I 
can do for you saving my life.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go blast off for home!~
Have a safe trip home, Slippy. [Done]|None
~
PleaseFindParts|I don't know where the parts ended up, but I'm sure they're on this level
somewhere.  Maybe you could find one of the local creatures to help you find them?  I'd be too
scared to go talk to them.~
A cowardly frog.  What else is new?|StarToadDammit
Ok, we'll keep looking. [Done]|None
~
GotParts|Oh, thank goodness!  Now, take them to the starship - it's straight southeast of here - 
and plug them all in.  Oh, please hurry!~
Ok, we'll do it. [Done]|None
You're pretty pushy for a frog.|StarToadDammit
~
StarToadDammit|I'm not a <CN:RED>frog</c>, I'm a <CN:green>StarToad</C>!  But that's not important
now.  Please, go fix the ship!~
Fine, fine, we'll go fix your darn ship. [Done]|None
~
FirstGreet|Oh, hello there!  I'm Slippy, the StarToad.  Please, you have to help me!~
What's wrong, little guy?|HelpMe
We're too busy. [Done]|None
~
HelpMe|You see, I was flying near Nexus on a survey mission.  All the warp zones on this planet 
destabilize the space/time continuum enough that the whole thing has to be re-surveyed every so
often.  Anyway, I flew too low and I ended up in the middle of a thunderstorm.  Do you know what
happens to a StarToad when it gets struck by lightning?  It's not pretty, I assure you.  My 
spaceship fritzed out and crashed off to the southeast.~
You mean, that ship we fixed a little while ago?|RewardForFix|IsShipFixed
Well, at least you survived.|QuestExplain|IsShipNotFixed
~
QuestExplain|I'll be in big trouble if I can't get back into orbit soon.  I'm running out of supplies,
and this level is crawling with monsters.  Please, could you see if you can fix my ship?  Some of 
the parts aren't at the crash site - they must have been scattered
by the collision.  There's a manual on the ship, so if you could just <CN:red>find the parts</c> 
and <CN:green>take them to the cockpit</C>, I'm sure you could figure out the rest.~
Ok, we'll give it a shot.|ThanksForTrying
Well, what's in it for us?|IllGiveReward
~
ThanksForTrying|Oh, thank you.  And be careful out there, this planet is crazy!~
Tell me about it.  Ok, see you later.  [Done]|None
~
IllGiveReward|Well, if you can fix it, I'll give you some equipment that I found during my surveys.  
It should be useful. ~
Ok, we'll see what we can do. [Done]|None
~
ThanksAgain|Hello again!  Thanks so much for fixing my ship.  Now if you'll excuse me, I've got 
to finish getting ready for takeoff.~
Bye, Slippy! [Done]|None
