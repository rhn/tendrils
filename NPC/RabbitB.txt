Hello, Mr. Rabbit.  We come in peace.|FirstGreet2

GetArmy|Hey, studs.  Are you ready to rock Mother Brain's world?
\n\n<CN:ORANGE>[ Kuni gestures at a batallion of 832,040 rabbits in infantry gear. ]</c>
\n\nIf you'd waited a bit longer, we could have had an army of 1,346,269.  But
this is plenty.  Fall in, dudes.
\n\n<CN:ORANGE>[ The army of rabbits salute, then fall into formation behind you ]</c>
~
Where did all these rabbits come from?|Army2
You and Kuni have been...busy.|Army2
~
Army2|Well, the rabbit philosophy is "Make love, then war".  You're totally ready to go
gate-crashing at that castle, now.~
Onward to glory.|Main
Lagomorph power!|Main
~
FirstGreet2|Hey, studs.  My name's Klo.  Hope the monsters around here haven't
caused you any trouble.  This whole area has gone to hell since Mother Brain's 
minions came.  I keep killing them, but there's always more.  Freaking minions.
~
Nice to meet you, Klo.|Main
~
Greet|Hey, studs.  How's the fighting out there?  Nothing beats going out and
trashing bozos.~
Hi, Klo.|Main
We brought you some honey.|GiveHoney|HaveHoney
Yeah, we're just on our way back out. |Bye
~
GiveHoney|~
|GiveHoneyB|||GiveHoneyTrigger

GiveHoneyB|Honey?  Excellent.  Oh, this is the good stuff, too.  You guys rock the 
party that rocks my body.~
Enjoy.|Main
So, can you do something for us in return?||NotDefeatedCastle|HelpUsPost
~
GreetHoney|Hey, studs.  Thanks again for bringing that honey.  How's it goin'?
~
Hello again, Klo.|Main
~
Main|What's up?~
Who's that other rabbit?||MetOtherRabbit|OtherRabbitPost
What can you tell us about this level?|ThisLevel
Could you help us in our fight?||NotDefeatedCastle|HelpUsPost
We'd better be going now.|Bye
~
GoodLuck|Hey, studs.  I see you've got the whole army with you.  You're looking 
pretty tough.  That castle will have no chance.~
Hello again.|Main
~
Congrats|Hey, studs.  Nice job at the castle - that was quite a battle.~
Thanks.|Main
~
ThisLevel|This level?  Well, there's not many people still living here, other than me and Kuni.  Everyone else
got scared off by the minions of Mother Brain, like the <CN:BRIGHTRED>steel golem</c> and
the <CN:Purple>slime monster</c>.  It's turning into a real dump.
~
Slime monster?|SlimeMonster
Steel golem?|SteelGolem
That's too bad.|Main
~
SlimeMonster|You've fought slimes before, I bet.  They're totally stupid, and not very strong.  But they have some
sort of freaky <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>Slime King</c> who orders them around.  If you see him, I'd watch out - he looks
like a big goofy blob, but he's pretty strong.~
What else is on this level?|ThisLevel
~
SteelGolem|Golems are things like rocks and water brought to life by wizards.  There's a weird-looking steel golem
hiding out on this level.  It works for Mother Brain...I think.  Mostly, it's just completely insane.  Probably
best to stay away from it.~
What else is on this level?|ThisLevel
~
OtherRabbitJerk|The other rabbit?  Oh, you mean Kuni.  Yeah, she's nice and all, but...well, you have to watch
what you say around her.  I got on her bad side the other day, and she's still ticked off.  I mean, what's her
deal, you know?~
What if you apologized to her?|Apologize
Yeah, I know what you mean.|Main
~
OtherRabbitNice|Yeah, Kuni.  Sometimes you have to be careful what you say to
her, but she's really something, isn't she?  I mean, check out those ears...~
Ears, yes.  Hubba hubba, and so forth.|Main
Glad to hear you two are back on speaking terms.|Main

~
Apologize|Apologize?  Why should <CN:BRIGHTRED>I</c> apologize when <CN:BRIGHTRED>she</c> started it?  If anyone
should be apologizing, it's her, I'll tell you that much.  No way.~
Ok, ok, sorry we asked.|Main
~
HelpUsA|Help you?  Sure, I can help you.  But you have to do something for me first.  See, I love <CN:YELLOW>honey</c>,
but I haven't been able to get any for ages.  If you got me some, then I'd, like, totally be on your side.  As it
is, things are bad enough without me joining some crazy quest, no offense intended.~
None taken.|Main|NotHaveHoney
Fine, you wait here, we'll march off to certain death without you.|Main|NotHaveHoney
Honey?  We just happen to have some.|GiveHoney|HaveHoney
~
HelpUsB|Well, I totally owe you for that whole honey thing.  Tell you what: I'll go talk to to Klo, and
apologize for calling her a...for what I said last week.  And then she's cool with it, we can help you
out in a big way.~
We'll try it.|Main
We'll go talk to her now.|Bye
~
HelpUsC|Yeah, sure thing.  Here's the deal: It'll take like 24 hours.  So, make yourselves scarce for a while, ok?~
Bye now. [Done]|None
~
HelpUsD|Hey, you've got like a zillion rabbits already, that should be enough.  Go to the castle, kick butt and
take names.  That's my advice.~
Ok.|Main
