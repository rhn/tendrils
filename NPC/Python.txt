We'd better be going now.|||ByePost

Hello2Snake|Yesss, I am a sssnake.  A python, to be precissse.  One of the noblessst of ssserpentsss.  
And quite a nice sssnake, even though thossse

AskForPie|Ah...before you go.  Perhapsss you could do me a favor while you're sssearching the maze?  One day I when I was
ssslithering around, I sssmelled something deliciousss baking.  It sssmelled like some sssort of fruit pie.  If you could
bring me sssuch a pie, I'm sssure I could make it worth your while.~
We'll watch for it.|Bye|||PieAskedTrig

Info|Well, thisss level is an easy place to get lossst.  If you crawl - or in your cassse, walk - in one direction for 
long enough, you'll probably get back where you ssstarted.  Some rabbitsss live to the sssoutheassst, near the ssstairs 
leading up.  There's a cassstle, which probably guards the ssstairs downward.  And there is sssome kind of ssslime monssster
to the northwessst.~
What do you know about the rabbits?|Rabbits
What do you know about the castle?|Castle
What can you tell us about the slime monster?|Slime
We'd better be going now.|||ByePost

Rabbits|There are two rabbitsss.  Well, at leassst for now, there are only two.  Rabbitsss are famousss 
for breeding, but these two ssseem to have had
some sort of falling-out.  A pity, because little rabbitsss are quite deliciou...er, that is to sssay, quite delightful.  
Yesss, delightful.~
What else can you tell us about this level?|Info
We'd better be going now.|||ByePost
~
Castle|The cassstle is well defended, with a moat and a garrissson.  You would need an army to ssstorm it.  I think that
Mother Brain originally sssent her troopsss to capture the castle to and ssstop anyone from getting deeper into 
the dungeons.  If you need to get to Mother Brain, I sssupose you'll have to find some way to asssail the place.~
What do you know about the rabbits?|Rabbits
What can you tell us about the slime monster?|Slime
We'd better be going now.|||ByePost
~
Slime|The mold monster is a disgusssting creature, all mottled color and horrible sssmell.  I'm not sssure what it'sss
made of, but I think that it would be vulnerable to lightning.  Yesss, that might do the trick.  I recommend avoiding it,
though, not fighting it.  Ssslimes are not known for keeping much treasure.~
