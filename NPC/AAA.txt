FirstGreet|Hello, whippersnappers!  My name's AAA, but people around here just call
me Gramps.  I may look like a crazy old coot, but I went
on many an adventure back in my day, killing princesses and rescuing monsters.  Or was
it the other way around?  The old memory's not what it used to be. ~
Nice to meet you, Mr. AAA.|Greetings2
~
Greetings2|Anyhoo, I've got plenty of stories from my adventuring days.  And if you
want, I can give you a few pointers on how to stay alive out there.  You're safe from monsters
here in Skara Brae, but things get dangerous once you leave town.~
That sounds great.|Main
Actually, we should be going.  World won't save itself.|Goodbye
~
Goodbye|Thanks for stopping by!  Remember to stop by the Save Shrines whenever you get
the chance.  Those things are keen!~
Bye. [Done]|None

Greetings|Well, hello again!  It's nice of you to visit an old fogey like me.  Are you
in the mood for some adventuring talk?~
That sounds great.|Main
Not now, thanks.|Goodbye

Main|What would you like to hear about?  I can tell you some things about <CN:GREEN>classes</C>,
to help you organize a party.  Or I know some things about <CN:GREEN>equipment</C>.  And
back when I was young and spry I was good at opening <CN:GREEN>chests</C>.  Or if you've
got a minute, you could hear one of my <CN:GREEN>stories</C>.~

Chests|Ah, there's nothing quite like the thrill of killing monsters and taking their
stuff.  Most of the good stuff is hidden in chests, though.  Chests have <CN:BRIGHTRED>locks</C>
that you have to disarm, otherwise the <CN:BRIGHTRED>traps</C> are triggered.\n\nThere are
several kinds of lock - one where you have to stop some spinning dials at the right 
password, one where you have to flip a lot the switches to the right position...  And you
have to work quickly, before the trap is triggered.  The locks and traps aren't so bad
around here, but they get tougher as you go deeper into the dungeon.  That's why it's nice
to have a <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>ninja</C> in your party - with those guys around, you get more time on the locks, 
and the traps are a little less deadly.~
Interesting.  What else can you tell us?|Main2
Thanks for the info.  We'd better be going.|Goodbye
~
Classes|Well, there's six classes in all.  The Fighter is the best at combat.  The Mage
and Summoner can dish out a lot of damage with spells, but they're not good at combat.  The 
Cleric, Bard, and Ninja are average at combat, and have other abilities.~
What do Fighters do?|ClassFighter
What do Ninjas do?|ClassNinja
What do Clerics do?|ClassCleric
What do Bards do?|ClassBard
What do Mages do?|ClassMage
What do Summoners do?|ClassSummoner
That's enough about classes.|Main2
~
ClassFighter|Fighters?  They hack and slash things.  They can wear heavy armor, too, so
they can take a lot more abuse than the poor squishy mages.  The <CN:red>tank</C> - you know, the
guy on the front row - is usually a fighter.~
Tell us more about classes.|Classes
Thanks, we'll be going now.|Goodbye
~
ClassNinja|Ninjas - or Ninja, whatever - are sneaky, and they throw those pointy
things.  Shuriken, that's what they're called.  Anyway, Ninjas aren't quite as good in
a fight as Fighters, but they are great at disarming traps.  Opening chests is easier and
safer with a ninja in the party.  I hear ninjas are also good with those new-fangled
sniper rifles the kids are all talking about.  I don't hold with that kind of tomfoolery
myself, just give me a sword, and a shield, and a 10' pole, and a lantern, and some
iron rations, and...where was I?  Oh yes, ninjas.~
Tell us more about classes.|Classes
Thanks, we'll be going now.|Goodbye
~
ClassCleric|Well, I recommend always having a Cleric in the party.  They can cast <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>Cure</c>
spells, which is really handy for restoring the old HP when you're not near an Inn.  
Clerics can also fix problems like poisoning, or stoning, or even death.  They can
<CN:RED>turn</C> undead, which does a lot of damage to ghosts and vampires and that sort
of thing.  Plus, Clerics can fight pretty well (though not as well as Fighters, of
course)~
Tell us more about classes.|Classes
Thanks, we'll be going now.|Goodbye
~
ClassBard|Ah, the Bard is an interesting class.  Having them around makes spellcasters recover
mana.  It's slow, but it really adds up over time.  Also, bards have some control over the Song of Battle. 
That's a nice trick, since it lets you use the songs you're good at, and avoid
the ones you don't like.  \n
Like that one that goes "DUN, dun dun DUN, tum-ty-tum-ty-tum-ty-TUM!"\n\n
I hate that confounded song.  Dagnabbit.~

ClassMage|A Mage is good at harnessing the hidden energies of the universe, mostly to 
blow stuff up.  Some of them can do some other handy things, too, like levitation and
scrying.  I was always most impressed by the whole blowing-stuff-up aspect.  Anyway, Mages
can't wear heavy armor, so it's best to keep them in the back row, where they won't take
so much damage.  And make sure they don't run out of <CN:BRIGHTBLUE>MP</C> (Magic Points)
before a big battle.~
Tell us more about classes.|Classes
Thanks, we'll be going now.|Goodbye
~
ClassSummoner|Ah, the Summoner!  Well, they can call upon powerful beasts to aid in
battle.  To do a good summoning, you have to follow the summoned monster with the mouse
pointer as closely as possible - or something like that, I never could get the hang of
magic myself.  Anyway, a skilled Summoner can dish out even more damage than a Mage. 
Summoners aren't good at hand-to-hand combat, though, so don't put them in the front row.~

Items|Well, there are <CN:ORANGE>supplies</c> and then there's <CN:ORANGE>equipment</c>.  <CN:ORANGE>Supplies</C> are things that you use up, like potions and antidotes.\n\nTo use a potion, choose the character
who'll use it, then hit <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>U</C> for "Use", then hit <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>A</C> (the letter next to
<CN:YELLOW>Potion</C>).  Or you can use the mouse, either way.  Then choose the character to use the potion on.  It takes a few moments to use an item (or cast a spell), and your character can't attack during that time, so keep that in mind.\n\nIn a battle, all this messing around
with items can be hard to do while still hitting the arrows, so it's probably best to 
pause first by hitting Escape, then use the items.~
So, what other supplies are there?|Supplies
Ok.  But what about equipment?|Equipment
That's enough about items.|Main2
~
Equipment|There are five slots for equipment: <CN:YELLOW>Head</C>, 
<CN:YELLOW>Body</C>, <CN:YELLOW>Weapon</C>, <CN:YELLOW>Arms</C>, and <CN:YELLOW>Legs</C>.  You
want a weapon that does as much damage as possible.  And you want your <CN:RED>AC</c> (Armor Class) to be as high
as possible, since that helps block the damage you take from monsters.\n\nSome items
can even raise attributes; Boots of Speed raise Dexterity, and a good shield raises your
maximum HP.  The deeper you go into the dungeon, the better stuff you'll find.  But 
remember that a character's class limits what they can equip - a Mage can't handle 
a Bastard Sword, for instance.\n\n
Oh, yes - you can equip items in the maze by hitting <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>I</C>.~
Interesting.  Can you tell us more about supplies?|Supplies
That's enough about items.|Main2
~
Supplies|Well, there are different kinds of <CN:YELLOW>Potion</c> to restore HP...and an 
<CN:YELLOW>Ether</C> can even
restore MP.  <CN:YELLOW>Antidote</c> cures poison, a <CN:YELLOW>Flute</c> cures silence, and a 
<CN:YELLOW>Medusa Scale</c> thaws 
people who've been turned into stone.  An <CN:YELLOW>Elixir</c> fixes everything except death.  And you 
can restore people to life with a <CN:YELLOW>Phoenix Down</c>.~
Ok.  But what about equipment?|Equipment
That's enough about items.|Main2

Story|Well, I could tell you about the Unjumpable Chasm, or the tale of Sir Wevel.  Or 
there was the time I almost died.~
The Unjumpable Chasm, you say?|Chasm1
What's the Tale of Sir Wevel?|Wevel1
How did you almost die?|AlmostDie1
Ok, enough stories for now.|Main2
~
Chasm1|Well, back long ago, there were these legends that if you gathered the Seven
Moon Crystals, you could summon some great treasure, or destroy the world, or something
nifty like that.  Anyway, the King really wanted these Moon Crystals, and he dispatched
teams of adventurers far and wide, to mountain's peak and dungeon's depths, until at
last they had gathered six of the seven crystals from their hiding places.~
What about the last crystal?|Chasm2
~
Chasm2|Well, the last crystal was across a deep chasm.  The chasm was too steep and 
perilous to climb down, so the
only hope was to jump across it.  Some of the bravest knights in the realm tried to jump
across, and fell into oblivion.  Some of the smarter knights even took their armor off
before attempting the jump, but still nobody made it more than halfway before they plummeted
into the chasm.~
Why didn't they throw a rope across?|Chasm3Grr
Why didn't they use an airsip?|Chasm3Grr
Why didn't they cast a levitation spell?|Chasm3Grr
So what finally happened?|Chasm3
~
Chasm3Grr|Listen here, kiddo, I'm telling this story, not you!\n\nNow where
was I?  Oh yes, the chasm.  Well, the King was not very creative, but he was
very persistent.  He sent more and more intrepid adventurers to attempt to jump
the chasm.  And one after another, they fell to their doom.  Well, it turns out 
the chasm wasn't actually bottomless after all.
So, eventually there were so many dead anthropomorphic raccoons and ninjas and
Italian plumbers clogging the pit that you could just walk across the top of all the
bodies.  A little grotesque, but there you are.  And that was how the last Moon
Crystal was recovered.~
So, what other stories have you got?|Story
That's it, we're leaving.|Goodbye

Wevel1|Sir Wevel was the strongest warrior the realms had ever seen.  He could behead
a bronze dragon in a single swing of his sword - and that was his backhand!  But Sir 
Wevel had a - well, a quirk to his personality.  He was obsessed with being complete.
If you sent him to, say, recover the Thunder Staff from the Tomb of Horrors, he 
wouldn't come back until he had opened every door, peeked in every chest, and smashed 
every barrel.  It could take a while.  I met Sir Wevel once, he was trying to figure 
out a way to get through the Jungle of Despair in under 20 minutes flat.~
Well, what became of Sir Wevel?|Wevel2
~
Wevel2|Well, one day Sir Wevel was sent to kill an evil wizard.  Name of Zorto, or 
something like that.  Anyway, Zorto heard that Sir Wevel was coming.  But instead of
barricading himself into his lair, Zorto flung the doors open.  When Sir Wevel got there,
there was a long row of wooden dolls.  Each doll was hollow, with a seam around its middle,
so that the top and bottom could be pulled apart to reveal - another doll.  And within 
that doll, another doll.  And so on.  Sometimes, inside the smallest doll there would be
a gold piece, or a peanut, or whatever.~
Well, that doesn't seem so evil.|Wevel3
Wait, you don't mean that...|Wevel3
~
Wevel3|Well, Sir Wevel couldn't resist opening all the dolls.  And just when he thought 
he was out of treasure...he would find ten more dolls, tempting him to find out what was
inside.  And then more dolls.  And for all I know, Sir Wevel is still in the Castle of Zorto, unable to tear
himself away.\n\nAfter that incident, we would call someone a "wevel" if they were
obsessed with mapping each square of a dungeon, or maxxing out every possible skill, or
capturing one of every creature.  ~

AlmostDie1|I remember it as though it happened just yesterday.  I had been sent, along
with Jigglypuff the Bard and Sushi the Ninja, to defeat the Dread Lord Orlox.  We carved
a bloody path through his underlings, but when we finally got there, he put up quite a
fight.  And just when we thought he was defeated, he changed forms into a bizarre (and
somewhat gross) beast with too many arms.  And then he fired this glowy beam of energy
that hit me dead on, and I fell to the dank floor.~
Wow!  What happened then?|AlmostDie2
~
AlmostDie2|Well, I was lying there, groaning in agony, unable to do anything but 
watch as my comrades got pounded.  When suddenly it seemed I could see some words.  At 
first I thought I'd reached the big High Score List in the Sky.  But then I noticed 
that some of the letters were backwards.  They looked like this: 
<CN:BRIGHTGREEN>3UNITNO) OT NIO) T43SNI</C>.  And there were numbers, too, counting 
down slowly.  And suddenly I heard this little fanfare, and suddenly my wounds were 
healed, and I felt better than ever.~
Did you defeat the Dark Lord?|AlmostDie3
~
AlmostDie3|That's DREAD lord, not DARK lord.  Sheesh, I thought my memory was going.  
Anyway, yes, we thrashed him good after that.  See, the key was to hit him in his single
giant eye.  He flashed when we hit him there, so we knew we were doing damage.  Anyway, 
once we figured that out, it was no problem.  And that's the story of my near-death 
experience, strange but true.~
So, what other stories have you got?|Story
That's it, we're leaving.|Goodbye
