Challenge10|Yes, we have met before - boss re-use is a key component of good dungeon management.

All right Sinistar, we'll take you on. [Done]|||Trigger

\n\nThere shall be ten questions, starting with the simple (worth 100 points) and 
working up to the truly difficult (worth 300 points).  If you get 750 points, you can
