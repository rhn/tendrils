FirstGreet|Hail, adventurers.  I used to be a thief and murderer.  Otherwise, I could not survive
in such difficult times.  Sit beside me and listen to my story of days full of adventure.~
Actually, we just wanted some advice.|Advice
~
Advice|Be warned!  The defender of this level <CN:RED>cannot be harmed</C> by weapons and magic.
Only a <CN:GREEN>summoner</C> can damage it!  A <CN:GREEN>summoner spell</c> should break its
protections, so that ordinary weapons and magic can damage it.  If you meet the great stone head
and have no summoner, you must <CN:RED>flee</c> or be destroyed.~
Can you tell us anything else?|Advice2

SecondGreet|Welcome back!  I will tell you the chronological story of a barbarian who dared to challenge.~

Killed|Congratulations on your victory against the great stone head.  You have done this town a great service.~
Thanks. [Done]|None

Advice2|The <CN:BRIGHTRED>fire knights</C> guard the rooms ahead.  They are tricky, never moving in straight
steps like you or I.  No, they always move <CN:BRIGHTBLUE>two steps forward</C>, then <CN:BRIGHTBLUE>one step
to the side</C>.  Approaching one straight on is safe, but together they guard most ways through.  I heard a
rumor that there is a <CN:GREEN>map</c> showing where the knights stand, that may help guide you past...~

GetKey|I see you are determined to face the peril.  Very well, please take this key.  It will unlock the door
at the north end of town.\n\n<CN:YELLOW>You have obtained: Silver Key</C>~
Thanks. [Done]|None
