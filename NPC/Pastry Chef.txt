L7Inconvenient|Dungeon?  Hmph!  The neighborhood has gone downhill since the Demon Castle moved in, but I still
don't think I'd call it a dungeon.~
Anyway.  What's for sale?|||L7ForSalePost
~
L7FirstGreet|Welcome to the Pan Panic bakery!  Now in two convenient locations, to better serve YOU!~
What's for sale?|||L7ForSalePost
You look strangely familiar.|L7Familiar
Convenient locations?  We're the middle of the dungeon!|L7Inconvenient

L7Greet|Welcome back to the Pan Panic bakery!    Now in two convenient locations, to better serve YOU!~
What's for sale?|||L7ForSalePost
You look strangely familiar.|L7Familiar
Convenient locations?  We're the middle of the dungeon!|L7Inconvenient
~
L7SoldOut|I'm all sold out, I'm afraid.  I'd better start baking!~
Ok, thanks.|L7Bye
Bake on, bakery girl.  Bake on for justice.|L7Bye
~
L7Bye|Bye-bye!~
Bye. [Done]|None
~
L7Familiar|Familiar?  Ah, I'll bet you've met my sister.  She also runs a bakery shop.  How is she doing?~
Pretty well.  She sold us some shortbread.|L7Sister
Not so good.  She's in the middle of a maze, surrounded by hordes of undead.|L7SisterBad
~
L7Sister|Oh, that's nice to hear.  I hope eventually these monsters go away so I can visit her.~
So, what's for sale?|||L7ForSalePost
~
L7SisterBad|Oh, dear!  I should send her some sort of card.  Or maybe some banana bread.  You know what they
say: When you're surrounded by undead, try a yummy slice of banana bread!~
Say, that rhymes.|L7Blah
Yeah, I don't think anyone says that.|L7Blah
~
L7Blah|Anyway, what can I do for you?~
What's for sale?|||L7ForSalePost
We were just leaving.|L7Bye
~
L7Crumpet|Well, supplies are a little low, so I'm afraid I can't sell you anything.  Unless...maybe
you're willing to do a favor for me?~
What sort of favor?|L7CrumpetQuest
Favors?  Forget it, we're leaving!|L7Bye
~
L7CrumpetQuest|There is a <CN:ORANGE>mold monster</c> on this level.  It sends spores EVERYWHERE!  I can't
bake anything now, or it will get eaten and turn into icky slime monsters.  But maybe if you killed the
mold monster, I could bake you something special.~
We have vanquished the Slime King.|L7CrumpetsDone|KilledMoldMonster
We'll see what we can do.|Bye
~
L7CrumpetsDone|Oh, hooray!  In that case, let me start baking!\n\n<cn:yellow>[ An hour of frantic baking later... ]</cn>
\n\nOkay, here are some <CN:BRIGHTGREEN>crumpets</C>.  I got so excited that I made an awful lot of them,
but maybe you can find someone to share them with.~
Thanks, bakery babe!|L7Bye|||CrumpetTrigger

FirstGreet|<CN:YELLOW>[You unexpectedly find yourself in a bakery]</C>\n\nHello, and welcome to my shop!  Sorry
it's in such an inconvenient place!~
Hello.  What's for sale?|Shop
Why on earth is your bakery in the middle of the dungeon?|FirstGreet2
~
Greet|Welcome back to my shop!  Sorry
it's in such an inconvenient place!~
Hello.  What's for sale?|Shop
Why on earth is your bakery in the middle of the dungeon?|FirstGreet2
~
FirstGreet2|Well, the overhead is very low.  But on the other hand, I don't get that many
customers here.  And getting supplies in the middle of the Cathedral of
Darkness can be a little rough, believe you me.  
Just the other day, some traders were bringing in some bags of sugar,
but they were eaten by monsters.~
Which?  The bags, or the traders?|FirstGreet3
Huh.  Well, what have you got for sale?|Shop
Why don't you try selling stuff to the monsters?|SellToMonsters
~
FirstGreet3|Both!  The monsters ate everything - the merchants, the sugar, even one of the 
wheels off the wagon.~
What have you got for sale?|Shop
Why don't you try selling stuff to the monsters?|SellToMonsters
~
SellToMonsters|Sell stuff to the monsters?  Hmm...that's not a bad idea.  Still, most of the
monsters don't have very refined taste.  I'm not sure whether they'd go for pastries.~
What have you got for sale?|Shop
Well, we'll be going now.|Bye
~
Shop|I've got a wonderful <CN:brightgreen>shortbread</c>, which I'm selling for just <cn:yellow>1000 zenny</c>.
\n\nEr...I know it's rather a steep price, but I don't get a lot of business, so I have to make
money somehow.~
Ok, we'll take one.|||PurchasePost
Too expensive. [Done]
~
AlreadyBought|Why, you already have some shortbread!  You should try it, it's delightful.~
We'll be going now. [Done]
~
NotEnoughMoney|It looks like you don't have enough money.  Come back later.~
Bye. [Done]
~
Bought|<CN:YELLOW>[You have paid 1000 zenny]</c>\n\n
There you go!  I'm sure you'll love it.  It's the best shortbread around.~
Thanks. [Done]
